# Cmod S7 Software Repository

This repository contains the Vitis workspace and software sources for all of the demos that we provide for the Cmod S7, across multiple tools. As each of these demos also requires a hardware design contained in a Vivado project, this repository should not be used directly. The [Cmod-S7](https://github.com/ArtVVB/Cmod-S7) repository contains all sources for these demos across all tools, and pulls in all of this repository's sources by using it as a submodule.

For additional documentation on individual demos, and for instructions on how to use them with your Cmod S7, visit their pages on the Digilent Wiki, linked below.
