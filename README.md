For instructions on how to use this repository with git, and for additional documentation on the submodule and branch structures used, please visit [Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/documents/git) on the Digilent Wiki.

Note: As this demo requires sources for tools other than Vitis, which are provided in other repos, it is recommended to get these sources through the corresponding branch of the Cmod-S7 repository, which uses submodules to bring in sources for all tools used by this demo. This is described in the Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories page, linked above.
